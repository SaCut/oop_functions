# Object Oriented Programming

## Functions
- Functions are blocks of code that need to be used multiple times in the code. Instead of writing the code again, a function allows to refer to the code that was already written inside a function.
- The syntax for creating a function is:
```python
def FunctionName(): # def is a keyword that tells the interpreter the function is declared
	some_code
```
- Function structure and arguments
- Functions best practices

### DRY
- Don't Repeat Yourself. A good practice when writing code is to oly write one time all the code that can be written one time only.
